# Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the paper **"On complex network techniques for atmospheric ï¬‚ow analysis: a polar vortex case study"** conducted at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford. The paper focuses on exploring how network-based techniques can help improve our understanding of metereological and climatological phenomena. This repository contains the code necessary to perform the analysis presented in the paper.

# Repository Structure

The code is organized into the following directories:

- **bob**: Reads output data from the model.
- **netcdf**: Reads observation data.
- **networks**: Contains the analysis code.
  - **buildnet**: Contains code to create the networks.
    - `mcorr.py`: Creates correlation-based Eulerian networks.
    - `mvort.py`: Creates vorticity-based Eulerian networks.
    - `mdist.py`: Creates proximity-based Lagrangian networks.
    - `msim.py`: Creates similarity-based Lagrangian networks.
  - **usenet**: Contains code to calculate and plot the network metrics.
